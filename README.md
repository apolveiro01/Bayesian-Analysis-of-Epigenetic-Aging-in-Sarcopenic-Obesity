Accelerated Epigenetic Aging and DNA Methylation-Based Telomere Shortening in Sarcopenic Obesity: A Pilot Study

Overview

This repository contains the data analysis pipeline, statistical modeling code (Bayesian inference), and documentation for the study titled:

"Accelerated Epigenetic Aging and DNA Methylation-Based Telomere Shortening in Sarcopenic Obesity: A Pilot Study."

This work investigates how distinct body composition phenotypes—sarcopenic obesity (SO), obesity, and sarcopenia—influence DNA methylation (DNAm)-based biomarkers of aging, including epigenetic age acceleration and DNAm-inferred telomere length (DNAmTL), through Bayesian GLM and quantile regression models.

Abstract

Background

Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is characterized by the coexistence of excess fat mass and reduced muscle mass and strength. Among the twelve hallmarks of aging, epigenetic alterations—including DNA methylation changes—play a central role in biological aging. Understanding how composite phenotypes like SO relate to DNAm-based age predictors can elucidate mechanisms of cellular senescence and age-related disease vulnerability.

Objective

To examine associations between body composition phenotypes (SO, obesity, and sarcopenia) and DNAm-predicted epigenetic clocks, focusing on intrinsic and extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA and EEAA) and telomere shortening.

Methods

A cross-sectional pilot study was conducted with 30 older women allocated into four groups:

Sarcopenic Obesity (n = 8)

Obesity (n = 8)

Sarcopenia (n = 8)

Control (n = 6)


The aging biomarkers were the following:

- Horvath Clock

- Hannum Clock

- DNAmTL

- DNAm PhenoAge

- DNAm GrimAge

- DNAm GrimAge2

- DNAm Zhang

- DNAm FitAge

Bayesian GLM and Bayesian QR were employed to model the relationship between body composition phenotypes and aging biomarkers. Two model structures were tested:

Model 1: Unadjusted

Model 2: Adjusted for chronological age and HOMA-IR (insulin resistance index)


Results

Sarcopenic obesity was consistently associated with:

- Higher EEAA, DNAm FitAge, and Hannum Clock values

- Shorter DNAmTL

Obesity alone also showed positive associations, particularly in adjusted models and upper quantiles.

Sarcopenia alone was not robustly associated with age acceleration.

No significant associations were observed for IEAA, Horvath Clock, GrimAge2, or Zhang Clock in unadjusted models.


Conclusions

Sarcopenic obesity was associated with accelerated biological and functional aging, contributing to accelerated epigenetic age as well as shorter telomere length predicted by DNAm. Obesity alone also contributes, though to a lesser extent. These findings support the notion that the combined burden of adiposity and muscle loss is particularly detrimental to biological aging trajectories.
